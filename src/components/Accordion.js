      answer:
        "Rome is a historic city with so much to see and do! For your first trip, I recommend visiting some of the most iconic landmarks, such as the Colosseum, the Trevi Fountain, and the Spanish Steps. You can also explore the Vatican Museums and St. Peter's Square. If you have time, take a walk through Trastevere, a charming neighborhood with narrow streets and hidden piazzas.",

    {
      title: "What are some hidden gems to see in Rome?",
      answer:
        "Rome is packed with hidden gems! If you love art, don't miss the Galleria Doria Pamphilj or Palazzo Barberini. The Museo Barracco is a free museum and well worth a quick visit. If you love the ancient stuff, don't miss the Domus Romana at Palazzo Valentini, the Domus Aurea, and the Baths of Caracalla. For even more hidden gems, take a tour of Trastevere, a fascinating neighborhood full of history and ambiance.",
    },
    {
      title: "How much time should I spend in Rome?",
      answer:
        "The amount of time you need to spend in Rome really depends on your interests and how much you want to see. If you just want to hit the highlights, you could see most of the major attractions in 3-4 days. However, if you want to delve deeper into the city's history and culture, you could easily spend a week or more. Ultimately, the best way to decide how much time to spend in Rome is to figure out what you want to see and do, and then plan your trip accordingly.",
